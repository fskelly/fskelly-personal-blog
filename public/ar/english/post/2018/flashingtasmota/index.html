        <h1>Sonoff Flashing Tasmota</h1>
        
      </div><p>So, there are a ton of useful guides out on the internet and YouTube on how to do this as they are really detailed, for example, I was using this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMiP9Ku71To">one</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G4tLa4Kt6A9e3hJ-HO8ng">DrZzs</a> and this is a great tutorial and this post this my &ldquo;issues&rdquo; and troubleshooting would not have been possible without the great tools mentioned by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G4tLa4Kt6A9e3hJ-HO8ng">DrZzs</a>, such as <a href="https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm">Termite</a> and of course the amazing <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">Tasmota firmware by Theo</a>.</p>
<p>So I was carefully following the process of using the FTDI adapter and then selecting the correct firmware, sonoff.bin from the repository and I was able to successfully flash the firmware onto my Sonoff Basic and &ldquo;backlog&rdquo; the required settings, I was feeling pretty good. So now it was time to start playing and connecting my device to my wireless network. So, 4 button presses and wait for a new WiFi network to appear so that you can connect and make the required changes on the web interface. So after around 2 minutes of waiting and nothing appearing, a simply power cycle might resolve this issue. I followed this process a few times in the hopes that the &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; would go away. No such luck, <strong>TROUBLESHOTING TIME</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2>
<p>So thanks to <a href="https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm">Termite</a> this was made a lot, simply open the software and start following what is going on at a serial level, so I start following the messages and it tries to connect to the network and fails and when it fails, it still does not create a network. I even think hey maybe it is my hidden SSID and try to get the Sonoff to connect to my mobile hotspot, no joy. So far,</p>
<p>Device flashed ✅<br>
Device does not create the required WiFi network for configuration ❌<br>
Device does not connect to hidden SSID ❌<br>
Device does not connect to shown SSID ❌</p>
<p>So enter our dear friend, <a href="www.google.com">Uncle Google</a> and I start searching and I came across an entry of the Github page for <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota">Tasmota</a> and someone mentions that flashing to the minimal firmware can help. So I find the required file and flash it onto Sonoff Basic as below and it magically works, so for the troubleshooting this has helped as I now know that my flashing process and understanding of the settings with Termite is correct.</p>
<p>So now that I have a working Sonoff Tasmota interface, try to perform in inline upgrade to the Sonoff.bin firmware and the same issue occurs as before. So what now? More searching and I come across a sonoff-classic.bin, slightly smaller in size and I follow the process I know to be working and it starts working. I am busy investigating the issue with the sonoff.bin file with my Sonoff Basic.</p>
<p>So, if you run into a strange issue, like me, this might just be a hardware issue. Remember there is a sonoff-classic.bin, with some limitations.</p>
